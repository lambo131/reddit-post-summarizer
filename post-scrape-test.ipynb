Remember that the decay rate of a nuclide is an observed average subject to all sorts of quantum effects, it is not a perfectly fixed rate. You could, theoretically, have 10 3-H atoms & they decay faster or slower than you would expect from the decay rate bc the decays are random. But in large numbers radioactive decay occurs in a very predictable manner. Reacting with water does not change the half life of 3-H by several orders of magnitude nor is there anything in the posters link to suggest this.
